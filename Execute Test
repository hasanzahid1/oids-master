          OID App Execute Test

Prerequisites
Download/clone the oids-master 

Building and Deploying
Follow the Instructions provided in oids-master/README.md for building/deploying the application.

Running
After building/deploying, run the helper script to launch the application.

$Open com/bouff/oids/OidAppTester.java doTest() change the ProcessBuilder path pointing to oids-master/bin/oid.sh



To Execute Test Cases Run com/bouff/oids/executeTestCase.java 
To Execute Basic Performance Test Run com/bouff/oids/executePerformanceTest.java

=================================================================================================

To execute Automation Test against the running CLI application, 
made use of ProcessBuilder classs such that arguments can be read and write against a running CLI applicaton.

Steps used to execute the Test:
1 Start the process using ProcessBuilder.
2 Build Test Set using hashmap with SNMP trap, expected output.
3 Pass the Test Set using getOutputStream and Read the result
4 if the result matches with expected result the test pass else fail

Example Test Cases:

1: OID is EXACT MATCH WITH PREFIX
expectedOutput.put(".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1", "true");

Testing value: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1"
Recieved from application: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1: true"
Test passed for: .1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1

2:  OID is PREFIX + VALID INPUT
expectedOutput.put(".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1.0.0.0.0.0", "true");

Testing value: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1.0.0.0.0.0"
Recieved from application: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1.0.0.0.0.0: true"
Test passed for: .1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.0.1.0.0.0.0.0

Bugs Found During Tests

Defect 1: When space is passed, the expected output should be invalid. But the application throws exception.

Ex :
Testing value: " .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5"
Recieved from application: "Exiting. Exception: For input string: " 1""
Test failed for:  .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5
Exception thrown. currectEntry: " .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5"

Defect 2: When Max Java integer value or grater is passed soon after valid SNMP prefix, the application throws exception.

Ex:
Testing value: ".1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.534532452345"
Recieved from application: "Exiting. Exception: For input string: "534532452345""
Test failed for: .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.534532452345
Exception thrown. currectEntry: ".1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.534532452345"

Note: if max integer value is passed after valid prefix + single number it does not throw exception.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.5.534532452345 this value does not throw error but .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.534532452345 throws exception.

Defect 3: When passing Java escape chars for a valid SNMP it gives Invalid Response. Since this is Java Application, it should be able to take escape chars.


Performance Test:

Executed Total Testcase = 16+ 24 + 13 = 53 ; for 100 times-  Executing 53 * 100 = 5300 tests in 80 secs
Running 5300 extries takes 80 secs, thus performance could be improved.
